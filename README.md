The Stroop Effect is a famous observed phenomena that comes in 2 parts. 
A test subject is timed reading a list of "color words". 
For example, the list may read "Yellow", "Blue", "Red", "Red", "Green" etc. 
In the first test, all of the words are colored the same color as the word describing them.

In the 2nd test, the words are colored differently from the word describing them
For example, the word "Yellow" may be colored red, the word "Blue" may be colored purple.
The test measures how much excess time the subject takes to complete the 2nd set of words compared to the first set.
